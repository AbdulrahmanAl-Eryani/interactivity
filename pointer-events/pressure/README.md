# pressure

Visualises the touch pressure. We use a helper library for this, but it's also available via pointer events. The benefit of the helper library is it takes care of a few vendor differences and lets you easily test with a regular mouse.

## Uses

* [chroma](http://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) - a colour manipulation library
* [pressure.js](https://pressurejs.com/) - helper library for dealing with pressure

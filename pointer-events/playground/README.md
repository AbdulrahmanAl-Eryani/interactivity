# Playground

This sketch is not meant for extending, but for getting a sense of when different pointer events fire.

## Uses

* [PEP](https://github.com/jquery/PEP) - A "polyfill" library to ensure pointer events are available regardless of your browser

## Live

* A [live demo is hosted on Glitch](https://github.com/ClintH/interactivity/tree/master/pointer-events/playground)
* You can [fork the code from Glitch to](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ix-pointer-playground)
